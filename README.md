## To-Do Warmup App

After finishing Origin Code Academy, I wanted to go back to the basics and make sure I understood the fundamentals of React, particularly state management and component separation. This definitely helped me solidify my knowledge of React since I recall a similar repo ([VSTDA](https://github.com/ZGoldman8/startnow-react100-vstda)) taking me nearly two weeks to finish when I was first learning React, while I got this done in a few hours!
